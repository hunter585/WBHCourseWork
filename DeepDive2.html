<h3>Question 1</h3>
<dd>What request type is common across all three (WMS, WFS, WCS) OGC web services that we have learned about?
<p>WMS GetCapabilities</p>
<h3>Answer the following questions about a WMS GetCapabilities request.</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<dt>Question 2</dt>
<dd>What are the required parameters, and what do they represent?
<p>SERVICE=WMS ... service type.</p>
<p>REQUEST=GetCapabilities ... request name.</p>
<p>Other parameters are optional.</p> 
<dd>What is returned in response to a WMS GetCapabilities request?
<p>This is from the esri site:
The GetCapabilities request provides the following information about a WMS service:</p>
<p>All interfaces a WMS service can support</p>
<p>Image formats it can serve (e.g. jpeg, png, gif)</p>
<p>List of spatial reference systems available for delivery of map data</p>
<p>List of all exception formats for return of exceptions</p>
<p>List of all vendor specific capabilities (or properties) that are available for modifying or controlling actions of the service with the current value of each capability</p>
<p>List of one or more map layers available in the service</p>
<p>List of layers supporting the optional GetFeatureInfo interface</p>
    

<h3>Answer the following questions about a WMS GetMap request</h3>
<dl>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<dd>What are the required parameters, and what do they represent?</dd>
<p>VERSION=version ... Request version.</p>
<p>REQUEST=GetMap ... Request name.</p>
<p>LAYERS=layer_list ... Comma-separated list of one or more map layers.</p>
<p>STYLES=style_list ... Comma-separated list of one rendering style per requested layer. Optional if SLD parameter is present.</p>
<p>SRS=namespace:identifier ... Spatial Reference System.</p>
<p>CRS=namespace:identifier ... Spatial Reference System.</p>
<p>BBOX=minx,miny,maxx,maxy ... Bounding box corners (lower left, upper right)in SRS units.</p>
<p>WIDTH=output_width ... 1R0 Width in pixels of map picture.</p>

<dd>What is returned in response to a WMS GetMap request?
<p>From esri: "A GetMap request retrieves a map from a WMS site. GetMap allows the client to specify distinct layers, the spatial reference system, the geographic area, and other parameters describing the returned map format."</p>
<dd><p>What is the significance of transparency in WMS requests?</p>
<p> From esri: It provides a "Map’s background transparency. Default is FALSE."</p>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>What OGC request would you use to inform the configuration of a client application (like ArcGIS) about an OGC service that you want to add layers from?</p>
<p>"GetCapabilites" request will inform the configuration in an application like ArcGIS about an OGC service for adding layers.</p>
</dl>
<p>Which OGC request would you submit under the following circumstances (include both the service type [e.g. WMS, WFS, WCS], and the request [e.g. GetMap, GetCapabilities, GetCoverage, etc.] in your answer)</p>
<dl>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<dd>You want a map image representing three layers of data in a single JPEG for a specified area of interest.</dd>
<dd>You want to retrieve data representing geometries and associated attributes for a road network, with the returned data in GML.
</dd>
<dd><p>You want to retrieve data representing a digital elevation model (a raster dataset) in the form of a GeoTIFF.</p>
</dd>
<h3>Question 6 - What are the EPSG codes of the following Spatial Reference Systems</h3>
<dd>WGS 84 (Geodetic CRS [geographic 2d]) ... Code is EPSG:4326</dd>
<p></p>
<dd>NAD83 / UTM zone 13N ... Code is EPSG:26913</dd>
<p></p>
<dd><p>NAD27 / UTM zone 13N ... Code is EPSG:26712</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Use the <code>cs2cs</code> utility to convert the following WGS84 Geographic Coordinates [EPSG:4326] into UTM Zone 13, NAD83 [EPSG:2957] coordinates. Include your <code>cs2cs</code> command and output in your writeup.</p>
<dl>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<dd>35d14'19.29" N, 107d36'30.67" W (Mount Taylor Summit)</dd>
<p>262635.74 (longitude) 3902633.36 (long)</p>

<dd>34d16'40.34" N, 103d19'28.49" W (Blackwater Draw)</dd>
<p>654223.84 (longitude) 3794236.77 (long)</p>
