<h1>Week 10 - OpenLayers Mapping Assignment and peer-review</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Question 1: What area do you want to depict in your map? Why?</h2>
<p>This specific map shows the results of the 2010 US House elections across the U.S. It is an example of how maps
can be visually deceiving. At first glance, one would see the vast red areas and believe that the Republican Party
controlled almost the entire country. In reality, much of the red spaces are virtually empty, particularly in the Rocky
mountain area.</p>
    
<h2>Question 2: What is the center point (latitude and longitude) of your area of interest?</h2>
<p>I used EPSG:4326. The latitude and longitude for it is 0 degrees and 0 degrees. That is, it is on the equator and
  at the same latitude as Greenwich, England.</p>
    
<h2>Question 3: What base map(s) did you select for use in your map? Why?</h2>
<p>The base map is OpenLayers.Layer.OSM. It is an appropriate foundation map to use for this exercise. The second layer is
http://webservices.nationalatlas.gov that provided two layers - one showing the US House districts and the second
showing the party that won each district.</p>
    
<h2>Question 4: What is the scale of your map (local, regional, continental, global)? How will this translate 
into your selection of an appropriate default zoom level for your map?</h2>
<p>The scale of this map is continental, focusing on North America. The zoom level was calculated to show the continental
US.</p>
