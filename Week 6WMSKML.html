<p>As with the previous milestones, please link your web page with your writeup from your homepage in GitHub.</p>
<p>There are a large number of WMS services available on the web. One way to find interesting services is to search for them using standard search engines such as Google. Try searching for the following search phrase:</p>
<p><code>“REQUEST=GetCapabilities” and “SERVICE=WMS”</code></p>
<p>as a single search phrase</p>
<dl>
<h2> Question 1: What search engine did you use?</h2>    <i> </i>
<p>    Google</p>
<h3> Question 2: >How many ‘hits’ did you get?</h3>
<p>    Request=GetCapabilities: 61,300 results and Request=WMS: 13,700 results</p>
<h3> Question 3: How useful (generally in terms of getting a pointers to live WMS services [defined as a functioning GetCapabilities request]) were the ‘hits’?</h3>
<p>A brief look at the titles of the hits suggests they will be very useful. Need to examine them further for a complete answer.</p>
</dl>
<p>Pick two of the services that included live &quot;GetCapabilities&quot; requests that you found above, and answer the following questions about each.</p>
<dl>
<h3> Question 4 (service #1)</h3>
<p><i>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?</i></p>
<p>http://inspire.wales.gov.uk/maps/Protected_sites/wms?request=getCapabilities</p>
<p><i>What is the Name of the service?</i></p>
<p>WWelsh Government WMS View Service</p>
<p><i>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?</i></p>
<p>It is available in many formats including ... image/png,application/atom+xml,application/pdf,application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml,application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml; mode=networklink,application/vnd.google-earth.kmz, image/geotiff,image/geotiff8, image/gif,image/jpeg,image/png; mode=8bit,image/svg+xml,image/tiff,image/tiff8 </p>
<p><i>How many layers are included in the service (including nesting layers)?</i></p>
<p>There are 35 separate layers.</p>
<h3> Question 4 (service #2)</h3>
<p><i>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?</i></p>
<p>http://services.ogc.noaa.gov/geoserver/geoss_water_sba/wms?request=getcapabilities</p>
<p><i>What is the Name of the service?</i></p>
<p>GeoServer Web Map Service</p>
<p><i>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?</i></p>
<p>Several formats including: image/png, application/atom+xml, application/pdf, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml;mode=networklink, application/vnd.google-earth.kmz, image/geotiff, image/geotiff8, image/gif, image/jpeg, image/png; mode=8bit, image/svg+xml, image/tiff, image/tiff8</p>
<p><i>How many layers are included in the service (including nesting layers)?</i></p>
<p>There are 5 layers in this URL.</p>
<h3>Question 5: For one of the layers in the first service,</h3>
<p><i>What is the name of the layer?</i></p>
<p>Local Nature Reserves.</p>
<p><i>What is the SRS of the layer?</i></p>
<p>EPSG:27700</p>
<p><i>What is the name of the projection that matches the SRS EPSG code?</i></p>
<p>OSGB 1936 / British National Grid</p>
<p><i>What is the LatLonBoundingBox of the layer?</i></p>
</p> westBoundLongitude: -5.131691736668921

<h2>Open the following GetCapabilities request in your browser. Select “View Source” from the browser menu to see the delivered XML document (it may appear as an unformatted string of text by default in your browser - if that is the case, save the file to your hard drive and view it in a text editor). Use the information in the XML capabilities document to formulate <code>GetMap</code> requests for the following map images. Include the requests and resulting images in your write-up. Comment on anything unusual that you notice in the images that are returned.</h2>

<h3>Question 6: for the area surrounding Bernalillo County (-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25) as a 200x200 pixel JPEG</h3>
<p>Here is the request and the output: </p>
<p>http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/97810/services/ogc/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25&LAYERS=2007fe_35_county00&WIDTH=200&HEIGHT=200&SRS=EPSG:4326&FORMAT=gif</p>

<h3>for the same area as a 500x500 pixel PNG</h3>
<p>http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/97810/services/ogc/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25&LAYERS=2007fe_35_county00&WIDTH=500&HEIGHT=500&SRS=EPSG:4326&FORMAT=gif</p>

<p>Both of these Bernalillo county images appear distorted - somewhat fat.</p>




<p>Open the following (linked) KML file in Google Earth, uncompress it, and save the contained KML file on your computer. Open the KML file in a text editor (e.g. Text Wrangler [Mac], Notepad/Notepad++ [Windows]).</p>
<p><a href="http://rgis.unm.edu/gstore/datasets/3f0a85aa-b7f8-47bd-8db6-1c0e66becf72/nm_state_bdy_00.derived.kml">http://rgis.unm.edu/gstore/datasets/3f0a85aa-b7f8-47bd-8db6-1c0e66becf72/nm_state_bdy_00.derived.kml</a></p>
<h3>Question 7 : Add a second <em>Placemark</em> element to the KML file that represents a <em>square</em> region that is completely contained within the state boundary. Save the KML file and open it in Google Earth (download from http://www.google.com/earth/index.html) or view it in Google Maps (by adding it to your GitHub <code>gh-pages</code> branch) as demonstrated in the lecture to verify that you have successfully created the file. Submit the KML file (as a link in your writeup) as part of your writeup for the milestone.</h3>
